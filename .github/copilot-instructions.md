Students are beginners learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We do not use advanced CSS layout methods like grid.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

This student is expanding on the project, and can start working with intermediate code if explained.
